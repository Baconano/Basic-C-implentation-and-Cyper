# Basic-C-implentation-and-Cyper
Basic Knowledge from what I learned in this project
ROT-13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
ROT-N is a type of Caesar cipher, which just shifts based on the input variable, including negative and positive numbers

## Features 
- **Simple Substitution Cipher**
  Maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique letter using a custom key.
-**Letter Frequency Counter**
  Counts how many times each letter appears in a string.
- **Homophonic Substitution Cipher**
  Maps some letters to multiple possible symbols, chosen randomly, to reduce frequency
  

Practices some C++ 
remember how to run it 
g++ Problem1.cpp -o main
main.exe

Main can be any lol i just like basic things
